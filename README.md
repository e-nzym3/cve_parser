# CVE Parser
Utility to ingest a list of CVEs and return a CSV that contains details on whether the CVE is a remote exploit, has POCs available, and links to the individual POCs.
<br><br>
This tool is a wrapper for CVEMap (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/cvemap).
<br><br>
## Initial Config
1. Download the most recent compiled binaries from the CVEMap repo releases page: https://github.com/projectdiscovery/cvemap/releases
2. Place the `cvemap` in your PATH. Run `echo $PATH` and put it in one of the folders that are returned.
3. Get yourself a ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform API key (it's free, just log in): https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/?ref=api_key
4. Run `cvemap -auth` and enter your API key. This will configure CVEMap with the key for future use, no need to re-run this command.
## Usage
```console
./cve_parser.sh [-c] filename
  -c  Cleanup chunk files after processing
```
The output file relies on the input file's name. If you use the same input file name, you may run into issues with overwritting. Try using unique input file names.<br><br>
_Note: CVEMap limits to 100 CVEs per run, so the script will divide input down to 100 line chunks_
### Example
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/e-nzym3/cve_parser.git
$ cd https://github.com/e-nzym3/cve_parser
$ ls
README.md  cve_json_parse.py  cve_parser.sh
$ vi cves.txt
$ wc -l cves.txt
448 cves.txt
$ ./cve_parser.sh -c cves.txt
